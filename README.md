# Hi there 👋

Welcome to the homework exercise for the role of iOS Engineer at Redbubble. We're excited and thankful that you're here!

# Intro

This project is a partial implementation of the first screen in the following design. It contains a grid of artworks and products.

- [Design mockups](./mockups)
- [Style guide](https://redbubble.design/foundations/color)

# Next steps...

#### Step 1

Given the above context, review the codebase and write down what you think are the issues, how would you improve them and why?

> Note: For the sake of this exercise, it is ok to make assumptions about any questions you might have to make sure that you can proceed with this step.

If you have any questions, about the features or design - include them in your response.

Just a few sentences is enough 🙂

#### Step 2

Now that you've reviewed the project, have a go at refactoring the code, adding tests and implementing the solution in a better way.

In this step, don't feel obliged to implement all the fixes and improvements you noted down in Step 1.
Do what you feel is practical in the time you have, and will assist you the most in Step 3.

You can choose to reuse as much or as little of the existing code as you want without any limitations.

#### Step 3

Now that you've refactored the project, we'd like you to extend it by implementing the [artwork details screen](./mockups/work-screen.png)

We'd like to have the ability to tap on an artwork on the first screen and have the app navigate to a details screen for that artwork.

You'll need to request the artwork's data using its ID from the API at `https://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/bff/workDetails/<id>.json`.
This endpoint contains all of the details needed, as well as the products this artwork is available on.

> For example: `https://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/bff/workDetails/326210.json`

# 💡 Some tips

- Don't spend more than a few hours on this exercise, we know your time is valuable ♥️.
- Your code does not need to be complete or production ready, just a good start that demonstrates your thinking and coding.
- You don't have all the answers, so make some assumptions, try some things out it's ok to make mistakes.
- Don't sweat the visual details too much.
- Code the way you like to code.
- We'll pair on your code later on in the interview process.
- We value testing in our codebases 😉

# 💕 Have fun

This is the most important bit.

We love what we do and are excited to come to work each day.
