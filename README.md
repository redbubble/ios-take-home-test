# Redbubble iOS Homework Task

Hello! Welcome to our homework task.

This task should only take you a couple of hours all together so please don't spend too much time on it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or make any assumptions you like as long as you document and have a good reason for them.

Good luck and we look forward to seeing your solution!


## The Task

Clone this template project. It is written in Swift 5 so please continue using Swift and Xcode 12+.

Try to avoid using any other third party libraries.

Assume that you will only have to support iPhones for now.

#### Step 1

This project has implementation of the first screen in following design. It contains a grid of artworks and products.

Using a production quality lens, review the codebase and write down what are the issues and why? How would you improve it and why? Just a few sentences is enough :)

Refactor the code and implementing the solution in a better way. You can choose to reuse as much or as little of the existing code as you want without any limitations.

If you have any questions, about the component features or design - include them in your response.

Implement the UI according to the visual design and style guide linked below.

Todo: figure out how to share design, style and assets.
Clicking on the respective UI element allows you to see the elementâ€™s text and colour styles (e.g. Headline7/textPrimary).
You can find the SVG assets for the icons in the root directory of this repo, next to this README file.

#### Step 2

Extend the project, build screen 2 and screen 3.

Screen 2 is details for an artwork, you'll need to request data with its id from the API at `https://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/bff/workDetails/<id>.json`, for example: `https://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/bff/workDetails/326210.json`

Screen 3 is details for an product, you'll need to request data with its id from the API at `https://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/bff/ios/productDetails/<id>.json`, for example: `https://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/bff/ios/productDetails/326210_minty-serviette_PJQVX.json`

We want:

* Implement the UI according to the visual design and style guide linked above.
*


## Expectations

We are looking for production ready code. This means we will be looking for all the usual programming best practises:

* thoughtful architecture
* tests (Feel free to use Quick and Nimble if you like. But XCTest is okay)
* documentation
* code style and readability
* no warnings or errors

This also means we will looking to end up with a working app and dare I say, even a delightful one!


#### ðŸ“® When you're done
When you're ready, you can submit your code and response to us via the link in the same email where you found these instructions.

ðŸ¤« Anonymity

We'll evaluate you most fairly if only our talent team knows whose submission is being evaluated.

Please don't put your name or other identifying information in your submission.

#### ðŸ’• Have fun
This is the most important bit.

We love what we do and are excited to come to work each day.

We know this sort of thing can take lot of time out of your busy schedule, so we ask that you do only what you're comfortable with and nothing more.

We hope you have fun working on this, don't take it too seriously - mostly we just want to get an idea of how you think and approach problems.
